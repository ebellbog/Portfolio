Since gaining a year of web development experience at TechChange, I have been doing occasional work as a freelance web developer. My most recent projected involving rebuilding an outdated website for an escape room business. (Escape rooms are real-world puzzle games for groups of 4-10 players.) My priorities were to modernize the style and layout of the site; incorporate more visual media and responsive design elements; and ensure that the site displayed beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.  

My rebuilt site is currently hosted at [roomescapefun.com] (http://roomescapefun.com)  
(and the old site is still live, for comparison, [here] (http://xscapetheroom.com)).
