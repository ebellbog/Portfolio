Since gaining a year of web development experience at TechChange, I have been doing occasional work as a freelance web developer. My most recent projected involving rebuilding an outdated website for an escape room business. (Escape rooms are real-world puzzle games for groups of 4-10 players.) My priorities were to modernize the style and layout of the site; incorporate more visual media and responsive design elements; and ensure that the site displayed beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.  

My rebuilt site is currently hosted at http://xscapetheroom.com  

(Note that, in the past couple of years, other developers have also worked on this site, and unfortunately broken a lot of the styling I worked on.)
