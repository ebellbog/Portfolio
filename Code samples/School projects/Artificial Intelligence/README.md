Together, these two classes (NNet and NNode) implement a neural network in Objective-C. They can accommodate any configuration of layers and layer sizes, and they provide functionality for supervised learning via back propagation. I wrote this code as part of my final project for an artificial intelligence class, which involved integrating machine learning into an iOS app I had previously developed.
