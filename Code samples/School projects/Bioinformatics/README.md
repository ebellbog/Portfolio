The code in this directory represents a sample of the lab work I performed over the course of a semester in a bioinformatics class at Swarthmore College. The material offered an introduction to a variety of versatile concepts, from dynamic programming, to Bayesian networks, to cluster analysis, all applicable beyond the immediate realm of bioinformatics. Along with my lab partner, Emily Dolson, I wrote this code entirely from scratch, using course materials as references.
