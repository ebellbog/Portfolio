During my last semester of college, I had the opportunity to pursue independent research into low-cost augmented reality solutions. My central idea was to use commonplace existing technology (like SMS-enabled cellphones and cheap laptops) to create a responsive and interactive audiovisual environment. Included in this directory is a scattering of code that I wrote, using Python and PHP, while exploring options for the SMS interface. (Also included are a couple of SMS-based games, “MasterMind” and “ParlorGame,” that I created for fun.)
