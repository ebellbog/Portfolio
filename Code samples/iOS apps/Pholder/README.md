(compatible with iOS 7+)

Pholder is a powerful photo organization app built on a simple concept: the ability to sort photos at the moment they are captured. Pholder faithfully reproduces the interface of Apple’s first-party Camera app, with the addition of streamlined controls for saving new photos into custom folders (or “pholders”). Users can either specify a default pholder, or ask to be prompted to select a pholder after each photo they take. The app maintains its own internal photo library, familiar to any user of the first-party Photos app, which supports transferring photos between pholders as well as favoriting them. However, perhaps the most powerful feature of Pholder is its innovative use of file metadata, along with a lightweight desktop assistant, to allow users to export their photos to a computer while preserving their organization.

Pholder currently remains in beta, waiting in a state of near completion while other focuses take priority.
