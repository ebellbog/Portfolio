I completed this app as part of a first-round challenge for an iOS internship position at Scopely, a disruptive mobile game company in Los Angeles. The task required creating an interface for rating relative popularity of friends, then displaying the overall results after a certain number of comparisons. Friend names and images would be pulled from Facebook, and the app would prompt the user for their login credentials. I had only six hours from reading the challenge requirements to submitting my final work, and I had no prior experience working with Facebook integrations at the time. Scopely accepted me for this internship in the summer of 2013.
