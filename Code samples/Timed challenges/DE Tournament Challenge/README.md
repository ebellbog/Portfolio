Hi, Scopely!

Included with this read-me file you'll find everything you need to compile and run my submission for your latest "client challenge." I have tested the final product under a variety of different circumstances (display types; network availability; etc.) and made sure that it is robust.

As requested, my app demonstrates proper utilization of:  
* Asynchronous downloading
* Blocks
* NSNotifications
* MVC paradigm

I have also chosen to include the following, additional functionality:
* Tournament is drawn in UIScrollView; user may double tap to zoom to focus (and back out)
* Pressing "Play" button highlights and zooms to next pair of teams
* DETree class is versatile, may scale to accommodate larger double-elimination tournaments
* App releases team logos if memory warning is received, then reloads the images as needed

To test my app on other JSON data (provided that it has the same general structure), simply edit the #define macro I've placed at the top of the app delegate header file.

Lastly, my code is peppered with explanatory comments and usage info, but please feel free to e-mail me at ebogdan1@swarthmore.edu with any further questions.

Thanks for your consideration!
